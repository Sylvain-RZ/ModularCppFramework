## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-18

### Initial Release

ModularCppFramework v1.0.0 is a C++17 header-only framework for building modular applications with dynamic plugin systems.

### Added

#### Core Components
- **EventBus**: Thread-safe publish/subscribe event system with priority-based handlers
- **ServiceLocator**: Dependency injection with Singleton, Transient, and Scoped lifetimes
- **ResourceManager**: Cached resource loading with reference counting
- **PluginManager**: Dynamic plugin loading with dependency resolution and hot reload
- **ConfigurationManager**: JSON-based configuration with dot notation access and hot-reload
- **DependencyResolver**: DAG validation, cycle detection, and topological sorting
- **PluginLoader**: Cross-platform dynamic library loading (dlopen/LoadLibrary)
- **FileWatcher**: File change monitoring for hot reload functionality
- **FileSystem**: Cross-platform file system utilities
- **Logger**: Flexible logging with console, file, and rotating file sinks
- **ThreadPool**: Thread pool for asynchronous task execution
- **JsonParser**: Built-in JSON parser with full JSON value support

#### Modules
- **LoggerModule**: JSON-based logger configuration with hot-reload support
- **NetworkingModule**: TCP client and server with async I/O
- **ProfilingModule**: Performance metrics collection and frame time tracking
- **RealtimeModule**: Fixed timestep updates for physics and simulation

#### Plugin System
- Dynamic plugin loading at runtime (.so/.dll)
- Dependency resolution with semantic versioning support
- Hot reload with optional state serialization
- Priority-based initialization order
- `MCF_PLUGIN_EXPORT` macro for easy plugin creation

#### Application Framework
- Application base class with lifecycle management
- Module system for static components
- Plugin context providing access to all core services
- Thread-safe architecture using mutex-based synchronization

#### Interfaces
- **IPlugin**: Plugin interface with metadata and lifecycle hooks
- **IModule**: Module interface with ModuleBase helper class
- **IRealtimeUpdatable**: Interface for frame-based updates
- **IEventDriven**: Interface for event-driven components

#### Examples
- Logger example with JSON configuration
- Hot reload demonstration
- Realtime application with fixed timestep
- Event-driven application architecture
