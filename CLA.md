# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## ModularCppFramework Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ModularCppFramework (the "Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Project.

This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it.

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual who submits a Contribution to the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

**"Project Maintainers"** means the individuals or organization managing the ModularCppFramework project.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce Your Contributions
- Prepare derivative works of Your Contributions
- Publicly display Your Contributions
- Publicly perform Your Contributions
- Distribute Your Contributions and derivative works thereof
- Sublicense the above rights to third parties

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to:

- Make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions

This license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity alleging that Your Contribution, or the Project to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Your Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.

b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and does not violate any third-party rights.

c) Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

d) If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that:
   - You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer
   - Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project, OR
   - Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project

### 5. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify the Project Maintainers of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

### 6. License to Your Contributions

Your Contributions are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0), consistent with the Project's primary license.

You acknowledge and agree that the Project Maintainers may distribute Your Contributions under:
- The AGPL-3.0 license (open source)
- A commercial license to third parties (dual-licensing)
- Any future version of the AGPL license

This dual-licensing approach allows the Project to remain open source while also enabling commercial licensing for users who cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements.

### 7. Moral Rights

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You waive, and agree not to assert, any moral rights that You may have in Your Contributions.

### 8. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in the Project is entirely at the discretion of the Project Maintainers. The Project is under no obligation to accept or include Your Contribution.

### 9. Warranty Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 4, YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO THE PROJECT MAINTAINERS AND BY THE PROJECT MAINTAINERS TO YOU AND ALL RECIPIENTS OF THE PROJECT.

TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

### 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR THE PROJECT MAINTAINERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

### 11. Miscellaneous

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [YOUR JURISDICTION], excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention"), and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.

This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and the Project Maintainers for Your Contributions to the Project and overrides all other agreements or understandings.

In case of Your death, this Agreement shall continue with Your heirs. In case of more than one heir, all heirs must exercise their rights through a commonly authorized person.

If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

## Corporate Contributor License Agreement

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, your employer must sign a Corporate CLA. Please contact the Project Maintainers at Sylvain-RZ@abclic.org to request a Corporate CLA.

### What is a Corporate CLA?

A Corporate CLA is required when:
- You are contributing during work hours
- You are using company resources
- Your employment agreement gives your employer rights to your work
- You are contributing as part of your job duties

The Corporate CLA ensures that your employer grants the same rights as the Individual CLA and acknowledges that employees may make contributions on the company's behalf.
